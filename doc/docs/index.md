# Introduction

The Open Health Stack's Analytics components provide a scalable and flexible
collection of tools to transform
complex [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) data into formats for
running _analytics_ workloads and building downstream applications.

Using OHS, developers can use familiar languages and tools to build analytics
solutions for different use cases: from generating reports and powering
dashboards to exploratory data science and machine learning.

## Key features

* [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org) based ETL pipelines to continuously
  transform FHIR
  resources to _"near lossless"_ 'FHIR-in-Parquet' representation based on a
  [natural schema](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md)
  for projecting FHIR resource to Parquet.

* Pipelines Controller module provides pipeline management and scheduling
  capabilities.

* Flexible deployment modes to meet the needs of different projects and teams
  from simple single machine to multi-worker horizontally scalable distributed
  environments. With support for local, on-prem or cloud based runners.

* Support for different target databases including traditional RDBMS (such
  as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)) or any OLAP engines that can
  load Parquet files (such as [SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/sql/)
  or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)).

* Simplify querying data by defining views in SQL or
  as [ViewDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-v2/StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html)
  resources to create flattened tables. Easily build analytics applications with
  common languages (e.g. SQL, python) and BI or data visualizations tools (
  e.g. [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)).

## Use cases

* The **primary use case** for FHIR Data Pipes is to enable continuous
  transformation of FHIR data into analytics friendly representations to make it
  easier for developers to: build dashboards, generate reports, perform data
  science task, and create features for machine learning models.

* A **secondary use case** is for piping FHIR data from a FHIR source to another
  FHIR server e.g. for integration into a central FHIR repository.
