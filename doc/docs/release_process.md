# Semantic versioning

Versioning across all Open Health Stack components is based on the
major.minor.patch scheme and respects Semantic Versioning.

Respecting Semantic Versioning is important for multiple reasons:

* It guarantees simple minor version upgrades, as long as you only use the
  public APIs
* A new major version is an opportunity to thoroughly document breaking changes
* A new major/minor version is an opportunity to communicate new features
  through a blog post

## Major versions

The major version number is incremented on every breaking change.

Whenever a new major version is released, we publish:

* a blog post with feature highlights, major bug fixes, breaking changes, and
  upgrade instructions.
* an exhaustive changelog entry via the release notes

## Minor versions

The minor version number is incremented on every significant retro-compatible
change.

Whenever a new minor version is released, we publish:

* an exhaustive changelog entry via the release notes

## Patch versions

The patch version number is incremented on bugfixes releases.

Whenever a new patch version is released, we publish:

* an exhaustive changelog entry
