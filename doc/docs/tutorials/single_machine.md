# Single machine deployment tutorial

The repository includes a "Single Machine" [Docker Compose](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/compose-controller-spark-sql.yaml) configuration which brings up the FHIR Pipelines Controller plus a Spark Thrift server, letting you more easily run Spark SQL queries on the Parquet files output by the Pipelines Controller.

To learn how the Pipelines Controller works on its own, [Try out the FHIR Pipelines Controller](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/wiki/Try-out-the-FHIR-Pipelines-Controller).

## Requirements

*   A source [HAPI FHIR server](https://hapifhir.io/) configured to [use Postgres as its database](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter#postgresql-configuration)
    *   If you don't have a server, use a [local test server](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/wiki/Try-the-pipelines-using-local-test-servers) by following the instructions to bring up a source HAPI FHIR server with Postgres
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    *   If you are using Linux, Docker must be in [sudoless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - this guide assumes you are using the latest version 
*   The FHIR Data Pipes repository, cloned onto the host machine

## Configure the FHIR Pipelines Controller

Note: All file paths are relative to the root of the FHIR Data Pipes repository.

**NOTE: You need to configure only one of the following options:**

1. For FHIR Search API (works for any FHIR server): 
   * Open [`docker/config/application.yaml`](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/config/application.yaml) and edit the value of `fhirServerUrl` to match the FHIR server you are connecting to. 
   * Comment out the `dbConfig` in this case.

2. For direct DB access (specific to HAPI FHIR servers):
   * Comment out `fhirServerUrl`
   * Set `dbConfig` to the DB connection config file, e.g., [`docker/config/hapi-postgres-config_local.json`](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/config/hapi-postgres-config_local.json); 
   * Edit the values in this file to match the database for the FHIR server you are connecting to.

### Flattened views

With the default config, you will create both Parquet files (under `dwhRootPrefix`) and flattened views in the database configured by `sinkDbConfigPath` [here](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/27d691e91d0fe6ef4c9624acba4e68bca145c973/docker/config/application.yaml#L42). 
* If you don't need flattened views you can comment out that setting. 
* If you do need them, make sure you create the DB referenced in the connection config file, e.g., with the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE views;
```
which you can run in Postgres like this:
```shell
PGPASSWORD=admin psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U admin postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE views"
```

For documentation of all config parameters, see [here](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/pipelines/controller/config/application.yaml).

If you are using the [local test servers](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/wiki/Try-the-pipelines-using-local-test-servers), things should work with the default values. If not, use the IP address of the Docker default bridge network. To find it, run the following command and use the "Gateway" value:

```
docker network inspect bridge | grep Gateway
```

The Single Machine docker configuration uses two environment variables, `DWH_ROOT` and `PIPELINE_CONFIG`, whose default values are defined in the [.env](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/.env) file. _To override them_, set the variable before running the `docker-compose` command. For example, to override the `DWH_ROOT` environment variable, run the following:

```
DWH_ROOT="$(pwd)/<path_to_dwh_directory>" docker compose -f docker/compose-controller-spark-sql-single.yaml up --force-recreate 
```

## Run the Single Machine configuration
To bring up the [`docker/compose-controller-spark-sql-single.yaml`](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/compose-controller-spark-sql-single.yaml) configuration for the first time or if you have run this container in the past and want to include new changes pulled into the repo, run:

```
docker compose -f docker/compose-controller-spark-sql-single.yaml up --force-recreate --build
```

Alternatively, to run without rebuilding use:

```
docker compose -f docker/compose-controller-spark-sql-single.yaml up --force-recreate
```

Alternatively, [`docker/compose-controller-spark-sql.yaml`](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/docker/compose-controller-spark-sql.yaml) serves as a very simple example on how to integrate the Parquet output of Pipelines in a Spark cluster environment.

Once started, the Pipelines Controller is available at `http://localhost:8090` and the Spark Thrift server is at `http://localhost:10001`.

The first time you run the Pipelines Controller, you must manually start a Full Pipeline run. In a browser go to `http://localhost:8090` and click the **Run Full** button. 

After running the Full Pipeline, use the Incremental Pipeline to update the Parquet files and tables. By default it is scheduled to run every hour, or you can manually trigger it.

If the Incremental Pipeline does not work, or you see errors like:

```
ERROR o.openmrs.analytics.PipelineManager o.openmrs.analytics.PipelineManager$PipelineThread.run:343 - exception while running pipeline: 
pipeline-controller    | java.sql.SQLException: org.apache.hive.service.cli.HiveSQLException: Error running query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for Parquet. It must be specified manually.
```

try running `sudo chmod -R 755` on the Parquet file directory, by default located at `docker/dwh`.

## View and analyze the data using Spark Thrift server

Connect to the Spark Thrift server using a client that supports Apache Hive. For example, if using the JDBC driver, the URL should be `jdbc:hive2://localhost:10001`. The pipeline will automatically create `Patient`, `Encounter`, and `Observation` tables when run.

Let's do some basic quality checks to make sure the data is uploaded properly (note
table names are case insensitive):

```hiveql
SELECT COUNT(0) FROM Patient;
```
We should have exactly 79 patients:
```
+-----------+
| count(0)  |
+-----------+
| 79        |
+-----------+
```

Doing the same for observations:
```hiveql
SELECT COUNT(0) FROM Observation;
```
```
+-----------+
| count(0)  |
+-----------+
| 17279     |
+-----------+
```

## What's next
Now that the data is available in an SQL queryable format, you can start to explore it using SQL or jupyter notebooks or build dashboards using common open source tools like Apache SuperSet.
