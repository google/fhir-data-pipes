fhirdata:
  # The base URL of the FHIR server.
  # Equivalent to pipeline "fhirServerUrl" parameter.
  fhirServerUrl: "http://172.17.0.1:8091/fhir"

  # Path to a file containing JDBC settings for connecting to the HAPI FHIR
  # server database.
  # Equivalent to pipeline "fhirDatabaseConfigPath" parameter.
  dbConfig: "config/hapi-postgres-config.json"

  # The path to output Parquet files to. The last portion of the
  # path is used as a prefix for naming the directory that contains
  # per-resource directories and a timestamp will be added;
  # for example, "config/controller_DWH_ORIG" will create something like
  # ./config/controller_DWH_ORIG_TIMESTAMP_2023-01-27T23-55-39.295824Z
  # 
  # For GCS file system dwhRootPrefix should be of the format
  # "gs://<bucket>/<baseDirPath>/<prefix>".
  # For Unix file system dwhRootPrefix should be of the format
  # "/<baseDirPath>/<prefix>" and can be absolute or relative.
  # dwhRootPrefix: "gs://fhir-test-analytics/config/controller_DWH_ORIG"
  dwhRootPrefix: "config/controller_DWH_ORIG"

  # The schedule for automatic incremental pipeline runs.
  # The format is similar to Spring's CronExpression, i.e.,
  # "second minute hour day-of-the-month month day-of-the-week", so:
  # "0 0 * * * *" means top of every hour;
  # "*/40 * * * * *" means every 40 seconds;
  # Scheduling very frequent runs might be too resource intensive.
  incrementalSchedule: "0 0 * * * *"

  # A comma-separated list of FHIR resources to fetch/monitor.
  # Equivalent to pipeline "resourceList" parameter.
  resourceList: "Patient,Encounter,Observation"

  # The number of Flink workers to use.
  maxWorkers: 10

  # Whether resource tables should be automatically created on a
  # Hive/Spark server. Primarily meant for single-machine deployment.
  createHiveResourceTables: false

  # Path to a file with the settings used to create tables.
  # Required if createHiveResourceTables is true.
  thriftserverHiveConfig: "config/thriftserver-hive-config.json"

  # The JDBC driver to use when creating tables.
  hiveJdbcDriver: "org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver"
