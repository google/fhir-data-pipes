   * currently generated, this is calculated using the ratio (Total resources processed so far /
   * Total number of resources to be processed). There are multiple steps involved in processing the
   * records. The completion percentage is derived as a weighted average of these steps. The
   * weightage for each step is a rough approximation derived based on the time taken for that step
   * as compared to the other steps.
