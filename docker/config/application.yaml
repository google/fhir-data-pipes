  # The schedule format is similar to Spring's CronExpression, i.e.,
  # "second minute hour day-of-the-month month day-of-the-week", e.g.,
  # "0 0 * * * *" means top of every hour;
  # "*/30 * * * * *" means in the middle of each minute;
  # Note a too frequent run might be too resource intensive.
  incrementalSchedule: "0 0 * * * *"
