# This docker-compose configuration is for bringing up a pipeline controller
# along with a local Spark cluster with a JDBC endpoint.
# The Spark part is partially based on:
# https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/spark/docker-compose.yml
# While all Spark pieces are brought up on the same machine but this config can
# serve as an example of how to deploy Spark on a cluster environment. Obviously
# extra configuration is needed when the underlying file-system is distributed.
# The spark components are:
# - A master node
# - A group of worker nodes (in this example just one)
# - A thriftserver providing JDBC and Metastore functionality.
# All Spark components share a common spark volume.

# Environment variables:
#
# PIPELINE_CONFIG: The directory that contains pipeline configurations, namely
#   application.yaml and flink-conf.yaml files.
#
# DWH_ROOT: The directory where Parquet files are written. This is shared
#   between all containers; the pipeline writes to it and Spark ones read.
#
# Note if local paths are used, they should start with `./ `or `../`. Also the
# mounted files should be readable by containers, e.g., world-readable.

# NOTES ON SPARK VOLUME:
# In the config below, a `spark` volume is used and mapped to /opt/bitnami/spark
# which is the default WORKDIR of spark containers below. On creation, the
# content of this directory is copied _from_ the container to the host volume,
# including file permissions.
#
# This volume mapping is done to persist temporary tables and Metastore data. If
# you don't use temporary tables and don't care about Metastore persistence, you
# can remove that volume.

# NOTES ON METASTORE:
# This configuration uses the default embedded Derby database as Metastore for
# the thriftserver. Example config lines are provided (but commented out) that
# show how to use an external DB instead.

# OTHER CONFIGS:
# If you want to change Spark default configs, you can mount your config files
# to /opt/bitnami/spark/conf/
# https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html

      # NON-EMBEDDED METASTORE CONFIG:
      # If you want to persist the Metastore data, e.g., table and view
