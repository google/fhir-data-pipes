# This docker-compose configuration is for bringing up a pipeline controller
# along with a local Spark cluster and a SQL console.
# The Spark part is partially based on:
# https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/spark/docker-compose.yml

# Environment variables:
#
# PIPELINE_CONFIG: The directory that contains pipeline configurations, namely
#   application.yaml and flink-conf.yaml files.
#
# DWH_ROOT: The directory where Parquet files are written. This is shared
#   between all containers; the pipeline writes to it and Spark ones read.
#
# Note if local paths are used, they should start with `./ `or `../`
