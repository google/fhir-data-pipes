# This docker-compose configuration is for bringing up a pipeline controller
# along with a single-process Spark environment with a JDBC endpoint.

# Environment variables:
#
# PIPELINE_CONFIG: The directory that contains pipeline configurations, namely
#   application.yaml and flink-conf.yaml files.
#
# DWH_ROOT: The directory where Parquet files are written. This is shared
#   between all containers; the pipeline writes to it and Spark ones read.
#
# Note if local paths are used, they should start with `./ `or `../`. Also the
# mounted files should be readable by containers, e.g., world-readable.
#

# NOTES ON SPARK:
# This is a very simple single-process Spark configuration to be able to run
# SQL queries against Parquet files generated by the pipeline. It exposes an
# endpoint on port 10001 which can be used for JDBC connection from any SQL
# client.
#
# For a more complete configuration which shows different pieces that are needed
# for a cluster environment, please see `compose-controller-spark-sql.yaml`.

# NOTES ON METASTORE:
# This configuration uses the default embedded Derby database as Metastore for
# the thriftserver. Example config lines are provided (but commented out) that
# show how to use an external DB instead.

# OTHER CONFIGS:
# If you want to change Spark default configs, you can mount your config files
# to /opt/bitnami/spark/conf/
# https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
