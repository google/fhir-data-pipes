# Run Static Code Analysis Using SonarQube

Relevant Sonar and Jacoco related configs are already added to the
[root pom.xml](../../pom.xml). When you run Maven, e.g., `mvn clean package`,
the relevant test coverage files are generated by default. To run SonarQube
on the code and see the reported issues, first you need to bring up SonarQube
docker container:
```bash
    docker-compose -f sonarqube-compose.yaml up
```

Build the package from the root of the repo and then run the sonar plugin:
```bash
    mvn clean package
    mvn sonar:sonar
```
Once the above commands runs successfully, you should be able to see the analysis
report in your browser at `http://localhost:9000`.

For any subsequent changes, just rerun `mvn clean package` and `mvn sonar:sonar`
and refresh the browser to verify your fix.
