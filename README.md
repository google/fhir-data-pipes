# What is this?

This repository includes pipelines to transform data from a [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/)
server (like [HAPI](https://hapifhir.io/),
[GCP FHIR store](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/concepts/fhir#fhir_stores),
or even [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org)) using the
[FHIR format](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) into a data warehouse
based on [Apache Parquet files](https://parquet.apache.org), or another FHIR
server. There is also a query library in Python to make working with FHIR-based
data warehouses simpler.

These tools are intended to be generic and eventually work with any FHIR-based
data source and data warehouse. Here is the list of main directories with a
brief description of their content:

- [pipelines/](pipelines/) **\*START HERE\***: Batch and streaming pipelines to transform data from 
a FHIR-based source to an analytics-friendly data warehouse or another FHIR
store.

- [docker/](docker/): Docker configurations for various servers/pipelines.

- [doc/](doc/): Documentation for project contributors. See the
  [pipelines README](pipelines/README.md) and
  [wiki](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/wiki) for usage documentation.

- [utils/](utils/): Various artifacts for setting up an initial database, running
  pipelines, etc.
  
- [dwh/](dwh/): Query library for working with distributed FHIR-based data
  warehouses.

- [bunsen/](bunsen/): A fork of a subset of the
  [Bunsen](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen) project which is used to transform
  FHIR JSON resources to Avro records with
  [SQL-on-FHIR schema](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md).
  
- [e2e-tests/](e2e-tests/): Scripts for testing pipelines end-to-end.

**NOTE**: This was originally started as a collaboration between Google and
the OpenMRS community.
