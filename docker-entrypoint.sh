# Enables jemalloc as the default memory allocator if it's available, otherwise the default glibc
# allocator is used. jemalloc is added to avoid the memory leak created by the glibc allocator.

# This is inspired from the flink-docker repo -
# https://github.com/apache/flink-docker/blob/45c6d230407d89aa83b0d170dd056d6868cf808e/1.17/scala_2.12-java11-ubuntu/docker-entrypoint.sh#L92
