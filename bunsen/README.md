This is a fork of a subset of the [Bunsen project](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen).
This is created to unblock us for pushing changes that are needed in the Bunsen
codebase. For example:
* Make exported resource IDs consistent (Issue
  [#55](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/openmrs-fhir-analytics/issues/55)).
  This is fixed by [PR #111 in Bunsen](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen/pull/111)
  but not merged.
* AvroTypeException for some edge cases (Issue 
  [#156](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/openmrs-fhir-analytics/issues/156))
  which needs a fix in Bunsen.
  
When development resumes on Bunsen or at least our PRs are reviewed/merged,
we can drop this fork and go back to directly use Bunsen artifacts. For that
reason we try to keep this copy as close as possible to the up-stream repo such
that commits here can easily be pushed to Bunsen in the future.
